# Notes

## Why we animate?

- convey the state of the app
  - inform the use about what could happen and what did happen
- style and branding
  - have a consistent feel across the app
  - app feels cohesive
  - gives the user trust

## Fundamentals

- Duration: how long an iteration of an animation takes to complete
- Delay: how long it takes before an animation starts. Only happens once
- Timing: the easing of an animation
